# Spring Login Form Project

This project is a simple Spring MVC application that demonstrates user authentication and registration using a MySQL database.

## Features

- **Login Functionality:** Allows users to log in with their credentials.
- **Registration:** Provides a user registration form with fields such as name, username, age, password, etc.
- **Database Integration:** Uses MySQL to store user data securely.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring MVC:** Framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **MySQL:** Database management system for data storage.
- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap:** Front-end technologies for a clean and responsive user interface.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/jk/controller`: Contains the Spring MVC controllers.
- `src/main/java/com/jk/userdao`: Manages database operations for user authentication and registration.
- `src/main/java/com/jk/dbconnection`: Handles the database connection.
- `src/main/java/com/jk/model`: Defines the User model.
- `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views`: Stores the JSP views for login, registration, and home pages.

## Setup

1. **Database Configuration:**
    - Update the database connection details in `Dbconnection.java`.

2. **Run the Application:**
    - Use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse to run the application.

3. **Access the Application:**
    - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the login form.

## Usage

- Visit the login page to log in with existing credentials.
- username:a and password:a for easy access
- Click on the registration link to create a new account.

## Difficulties Faced

1. **Class Not Found Exception - MySQL Driver:**
    - **Issue:** The application encountered a `Class Not Found Exception: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver`.
    - **Resolution:** We added the MySQL Connector/J library to the project dependencies. Ensure that the correct version of the MySQL Connector/J is included in the project's build path.

2. **Database Connection Issues:**
    - **Issue:** Establishing a connection to the MySQL database was not successful.
    - **Resolution:** Double-check the database connection URL, username, and password specified in the `Dbconnection.java` class. Ensure that the MySQL server is running and accessible.

3. **Styling and UI Design:**
    - **Issue:** Achieving an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design using Bootstrap.
    - **Resolution:** Experiment with Bootstrap classes and custom styles to enhance the user interface. Consider seeking inspiration from Bootstrap documentation and examples.

4. **Handling Form Submissions:**
    - **Issue:** Properly processing form submissions and managing form data.
    - **Resolution:** Review the controller methods and form actions to ensure correct data binding and submission handling. Debugging and logging can be helpful in identifying issues.

5. **Security Concerns:**
    - **Issue:** Ensuring the security of user data stored in the database.
    - **Resolution:** Implement best practices for password storage, such as hashing and salting. Regularly update dependencies to patch any security vulnerabilities.

6. **User Authentication Logic:**
    - **Issue:** Creating robust user authentication logic.
    - **Resolution:** Refactor the authentication logic in the `AuthController` and `UserDao` classes. Consider incorporating Spring Security for a more comprehensive solution.

7. **Error Handling:**
    - **Issue:** Improving error handling and providing meaningful error messages to users.
    - **Resolution:** Enhance error messages and implement proper exception handling in controllers and DAO classes.
